# DistributionHKModel
R code of Hegselmann and Krause model in distribution
The model is completely described in: 

Deffuant, G. Complex Transitions of the Bounded Confidence Model from an Odd Number of Clusters to the Next. Physics 2024. 

The R code contains two main functions:
* one for running the HK mode on distribuition and visualising the evolution of the distribution
* one for exploring the final clusters when the confidence bound varies

There is an example of command line in comment after each main function.
